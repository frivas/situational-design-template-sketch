# Situational Design: Sketch Template
A couple of days during the Alexa Live Online Conference there were a couple of talks about design. Both talks were amazing, very interesting and super fun. 

Both had shown a template to create conversations based on situations. You can find that template [here](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-cookbook/tree/master/tools/situational-design)

However there was a difference between the templates shown, the Music & SFX box. I have created the same template in Sketch. You can download, copy, distribute and modify as you please. If you improve it please let me know, I would be glad to see those changes.

The template includes symbols so it is easier to work with it.

You can also take a look at the PDF file for a preview of what the template is.

I hope you find it useful.

If you find any errors or have suggestions, feel free to reach out. :D
